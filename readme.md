**Aspect Ratio Calculator**:

I recently finished implementing a basic aspect ratio calculator. Below is a summary of its current features and planned future features.

* *Current Features*:
    * Allows for the calcualtion of any variable(`Inner Diameter`, `Wire Diameter`, or `Aspect Ratio`) given the other two values.
    * Includes helpful wire gauge charts for reference.
* *Future Improvements*:
    * Implement alerting for when user enters invalid values.
    * Ability to turn fractions into decimal values when entered into the value fields.
    * Implement ability to enter a wire diamemter via drop down/clicking a wire gauge from the table.
